# lpu-all-drives-info

This simple script can help you to fetch your desired number of drives happened in LPU. You can fetch Date, Company Name, CTC and Streams using this script. 

Follow below procedure to fetch the details.

- Download and extract the zip file into a folder
- Download GOOGLE CHROME and [CHROME Webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Make sure you download the right version of **WEBdriver**

After performing above steps, follow these:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

Once you have installed everything, open the **script.py** 
OR
open **notebook.py** which is a jupyter notebook file (Run this if you have jupyter installed and know how to use it)
> ❌ Please do not use any online jupyter platform like colab or Kaggle.

- Provide the Credentials, User ID and User Password
- Provide path to chrome web driver in the path variable
- Select number of pivots you want. (1 pivot contains 10 pages or 50 x 10 = 500 Drives). Not recommended to go beyond **15**)
> ![pivot_pages](https://github.com/amol-17/lpu-all-drives-info/blob/master/images/pivot_pages.png) pivot_pages
> - In above image, if you want the data till 30th page, set pivot_pages to 3, if you want data till 20th page, set it to 2 and so on. *The data will always be scrapped in forms of 10 pages minimum.*
- Run the saved script or run all jupyter notebook cells
